Trabajo y Ciudadania is a comprehensive and updated book that offers a valuable perspective on work and citizenship in the 21st century. It is suitable for students who want to deepen their knowledge and understanding of these topics, as well as for teachers who want to enrich their pedagogical practice with a dynamic and engaging approach.
  
One of the main objectives of work and citizenship education is to foster global citizenship, which is defined by UNESCO as "a sense of belonging to a broader community and common humanity. It emphasizes political, economic, social and cultural interdependency and interconnectedness between the local, the national and the global" [^1^]. Global citizenship education aims to equip learners with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that enable them to contribute to the sustainable development of their societies and the world.
 
Some of the key competencies that global citizenship education develops are critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, empathy, respect for diversity, human rights awareness, social responsibility and civic engagement. These competencies are essential for addressing the complex and interrelated challenges that humanity faces in the 21st century, such as climate change, poverty, inequality, conflict, migration and health crises [^1^].
 
Work and citizenship education also promotes healthy and sustainable communities by encouraging learners to participate actively in social, economic and environmental issues that affect their well-being and quality of life. By engaging in projects, activities and debates that involve local and global perspectives, learners develop a sense of agency and empowerment to make positive changes in their own contexts and beyond. They also learn to appreciate the diversity of cultures, values and opinions that enrich human societies [^2^].
 
Moreover, work and citizenship education prepares learners for the changing demands of the labor market and the workplace of the 21st century. By developing skills such as problem-solving, innovation, digital literacy, entrepreneurship and lifelong learning, learners become more adaptable, resilient and competitive in a globalized economy. They also acquire a sense of dignity, identity and purpose through their work and contribute to the social and economic development of their communities [^3^].
